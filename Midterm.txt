<html>
<head>
  <title></title>
<body>
</body>
</html>

<img src>


10.  Why do we use media queries?

Media queries are used to enable webpage content to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. Media queries allow the structure of the page to remain constant even if screen sizes and resolutions are different.


11. What is the main difference between a serif and a sans-serif font?
