<p class="byline">how mac miller's music changed with his life</p>

<div class="quote"> “My ideology was, if I just make very happy music then people will forget about whatever their problems are. I will forget about my problems.”
  <p class="quote-attribution"> -Mac Miller</p>

<div class="container">

<p>At the peak of his career, Mac Miller had left his mark on the world. The Pittsburgh native came a long way from his marijuana-centered, party-based and materialistic music. What emerged was a complex, artistic and soulful voice whose personal troubles reflected in his work. By the time he developed more into his music, Miller’s style ran from the cookie-cutter, repetitive teenage rap and into the dark, vulnerable and troubling reflections of his personal relationships, mental illnesses and drug abuse.</p>

<p>But how did Miller’s music shift with his experiences?</p><br>

<h1>The Emergence of Mac Miller</h1><br>

<p>We begin with the singer’s original debut. Formerly known as EZ Mac, (Yes, you read that correctly), Miller emerged into the rap scene in 2007. At only 15 years old, Miller released his first mixtape, My Mackin’ Ain’t Easy. Two years later, the ambitious teenager would come to be known as “Mac Miller.” Still on the come-up of his musical career, Miller signed with Rostrum Records in 2010.

<p>Miller’s first big mixtape, K.I.D.S, emerged along with his marijuana-centered melodies, 2010.</p>

<p>Take his song, “Outside,” for instance. Miller’s lyrics revolved around smoking marijuana:</p>

            <p class="lyrics">“Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?  <br>Cause it's nice out and we could get high  <br> Yeah, the sun shining and I'm feeling right  <br> We could post outside for the night...”</p> <br>

<p>“Everything was super melow,” according to Alfo Media’s review of K.I.D.S. “The beats were super fun, and all of Mac’s lyrics revolved around smoking weed, making a lot of money, being young, getting new clothes.”</p>

<p>“He was the definition of the whole swagged-out stoner persona.”</p>

<p>But with K.I.D.S. came one of Mac’s greatest hits, “Knock Knock.” Even then, his ambitions still reflected a youthful, money-focused style:</p>

  <p class="lyrics">“People was amazed I was still in high school<br> But now I'm out, and money what I'm 'bout<br>Trying to get so much that I can't keep count...”</p><br>

<p>Miller’s music continued to reflect his mellow and stoner ways. In 2011, Miller released his next mixtape, Best Day Ever, but this reflected the same repetitive and materialistic style.</p><br>

<h1>And his mixtapes continued...</h1><br>

<p>Fast Forward after another EP and mixtape and then comes Blue Slide Park that same year.</p>

<p>The studio album received criticism from across the board.</p>

<p>“Released two months before his 20th birthday, Blue Slide Park finds Miller rapping about crazy parties and getting money; his personality is effervescent, but his similes are clumsy and the production includes a grab-bag of dissenting styles,” said Billboard.</p>

<p>Regardless of the backlash, Blue Slide Park pushed Miller to keep going. In fact, from then on, Miller’s music emerged from the repetitive and stagnant into the deeper and more complex.</p>

</p>Miller was arrested for marijuana possession in 2011.</p>

<p>But his legal troubles would not end there.</p><br>

<h1>A man comes out of music</h1><br>

<p>Mac’s 2012 mixtape, Macadelic, was one of the first pieces of evidence that he wasn’t some washed-up, superficial young rapper.</p>

<p>He was a man of emotions and used music as an outlet.</p>

<p>His song, “Desperado,” reflected more of his mind at the time:</p>

  <p class="lyrics">“Put me in a room of people, how the f**k could I be lonely?<br>I only get money, these labels tryna clone me<br>Uh, my thoughts get heavy, hit the ground and crack the concrete<br>So, I try to keep 'em in my head<br>
It's sad to see when everything that you believe is dead…”</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Miller’s drug use began to take a turn. In his Macadelic tour in 2012, Miller played at over 50 shows throughout the U.S. and Europe. “To help manage the stress he started using promethazine,” according to Complex. “Somewhere along the way he became addicted.”</p>

<h1>A more personal touch</h1>

Miller’s music became even more personal with his 2013 studio album, Watching Movies with the Sound off.

In “The Star Room,” Miller reflects on the demons inside his own head and the repercussions of his drug use:
“But me, I'm still trapped inside my head
It kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm living paradise, so would I have to worry 'bout?
Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure
Find the perfect style
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs…”

<h1>Some demons don't die inside</h1>

Miller’s inner demons reflected even more in his 2013 mixtape, Delusional Thomas.

Miller recorded the material under the name Delusional Thomas, while using a distorted and higher-pitched voice in his songs.

“But to me it was a character and I wanted to give his whole own complete, like, everything,” Miller said in an interview with VICE.

“There was part of me that wanted to do my own voice, but I just wanted it to be its own complete character. And I feel like that evil voice inside your head is always kind of in that pitch.”

<h1>Depression, Drugs and Depth</h1>

Miller’s 2014 mixtape, Faces, offered more of a glimpse into his issues with depression and drugs.

The last song, “Grand Finale,” was meant to be Miller’s last song on Earth.

“He rapped as if tomorrow was uncertain, like overdosing was a possibility he considered to be drawing nearer,” wrote Yoh Phillips of DJBooth.

The mixtape “chronicled his depression and how ‘a drug habit like Philip Hoffman will probably put me in a coffin,’ mentioning cocaine, codeine cough syrup and even angel dust,” according to Alex Gale of Billboard.

“Faces was, in short, super depressing, and I’m not as depressed anymore,” Miller said in a Billboard interview. “Making music when you’re depressed is great therapy, but I wanted [GO:OD AM] to be in a different headspace.”

<h1>A new kind of voice</h1>

Critics saw Miller’s third studio album, GO:OD AM, as his most refined project of 2015.

“And on the transparent, relaxed GO:OD AM, he sounds like someone’s troubled little brother made good: from the album’s opening horns, you can sense that this is a victory lap for Mac, a homecoming,” according to Tayler Montague of Pitchfork.

Miller’s song “Clubhouse” points to his growing fame and influence:

“And I don't see why these kids wanna grow up to be just like me (Yeah)
I was a nobody, now my name in they mouth
Came for a steak but I left with the cow
And they hate when you great though
Ain't shit change but my checking account (Mac Milly)...”


“As is the case with so many talented young people who become rich and successful at lightning speed, soon enough, Miller was pretty heavily hooked on drugs,” Patricia Garcia of Vogue said.

<h1>The album that led to everything</h1>

But Miller’s 2016 studio album, The Divine Feminine, changed everything for him.

As Garcia notes, “gone are the lyrics about drugs, money, and death; instead, The Divine Feminine is upbeat, hopeful, and pretty damn sexy, too.”

Miller began dating pop-star Ariana Grande in August 2016. Grande accompanied Miller in The Divine Feminine track, “My Favorite Part.”

“That song is beautiful and it’s an aspect about my life,” Miller said in an interview with Vogue.

“I’m still trying to figure out how to navigate [talking about my relationship].”

Miller’s lyrics in The Divine Feminine prove that love had become his new drug.

“I think it also opened the door for me to become a bit more vulnerable with how I speak and what I say and how I use my voice,” Miller said.


Shortly he released The Divine Feminine, Miller was nearly three months into sobriety.

“I am actually completely sober for the first time,” Miller told Vogue. “I’m just changing how I live life, my state of mind.”

But sobriety did not last long for him. “I’ve spent a good time very sober and now I’m just, like, living regularly,” Miller said in an April 2017 interview with W Magazine.

“I think it’s important. I don’t believe in absolute anything.”

In May 2018, Miller and Grande parted ways.

“We worked through good times, bad times, stress and everything else,” Miller said to Billboard.
“And then it came to an end and we both moved on. And it’s that simple, you know?”

Miller was arrested on DUI and hit-and-run charges later that month, according to Us Weekly.

<h1>On the verge of death</h1>

Miller dug even deeper into his insecurities, sadness and depression with his 2018 studio album, Swimming.

“There’s some material in Swimming that goes far deeper than Mac has ever gone before,” Alfo Media notes. “It’s almost as if Mac is trying to find the lightest parts in a very dark point in his life.”

Miller recognizes his sadness and uses his music as a way to understand his feelings. The album debuted only three months after Miller and Grande broke up.

In the beginning of “Come Back to Earth,” Miller is aware of the mistakes he’s made:

“My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head...”

Little did the world know that Swimming was the last album Miller would release while alive.

Miller died at the age of 26 in his Los Angeles home on September 7, 2018.


The cause: a deadly combination of cocaine, fentanyl and alcohol, according to NBC News.

<h1>Miller’s life ended, but his music didn’t</h1>

His studio album, Circles, was released posthumously in January 2020.

“It’s an optimistic epilogue to the life of an aspirational artist,” noted Pitchfork in their album review.

“Circles provides some resolution and helps finish Miller’s final thoughts.”

Miller bridges together the struggle of mental health and realizing there are ways to deal with it.

As Pitchfork notes, his lyrics in “Surf” serve as a thesis for the album:

“And I know that somebody knows me
I know somewhere there's home
I'm startin' to see that all I have to do is get up and go…”

His posthumous work is an act of reflection and self-improvement. Miller pieces together his life.

<p>“The day that I die on will turn me into an icon,” Miller once said.</p>

<p>He surely wasn’t wrong.</p>
