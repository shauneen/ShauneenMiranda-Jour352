<p class="subhead">
<p> t the peak of his career, Mac Miller had left his mark on the world.</p>
</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh native came a long way from his marijuana-centered, party-based and materialistic music.</p>

<p>What emerged was a complex, artistic and soulful voice whose personal troubles reflected in his work.</p>

<p>By the time he developed more into his music, Miller’s style ran from the cookie-cutter, repetitive teenage rap and into the dark, vulnerable and troubling reflections of his personal relationships, mental illnesses and drug abuse.</p>

<p>But how did Miller’s music shift with his experiences?</p><br>

<h1 id="emerge">The Emergence of Mac Miller</h1><br>

<p>We begin with the singer’s original debut. Formerly known as EZ Mac, (Yes, you read that correctly), Miller emerged into the rap scene in 2007.</p>
<p>At only 15 years old, Miller released his first mixtape, <span class="italic"> My Mackin’ Ain’t Easy.</span></p>
<img src="images/mackin.jpg">


<p>Two years later, the ambitious teenager would come to be known as “Mac Miller.”</p>
<p>Still on the come-up of his musical career, Miller signed with Rostrum Records in 2010.</p>

<p>Miller’s first big mixtape, <span class="italic">K.I.D.S</span>, emerged along with his marijuana-centered melodies, 2010.</p>
<img src="images/kids.jpg" width="400" height="400" text-align="center">

<p>Take his song, “Outside,” for instance. Miller’s lyrics revolved around smoking marijuana:</p>

            <p class="lyrics">“Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?  <br>Cause it's nice out and we could get high  <br> Yeah, the sun shining and I'm feeling right  <br> We could post outside for the night...”</p> <br>

<p>“Everything was super melow,” according to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFCZroOJ8e0"target="_blank">Alfo Media’s </a>review of<span class="italic">K.I.D.S.</span> “The beats were super fun, and all of Mac’s lyrics revolved around smoking weed, making a lot of money, being young, getting new clothes.”</p>

<p>“He was the definition of the whole swagged-out stoner persona.”</p>

<p>But with <span class="italic">K.I.D.S.</span> came one of Mac’s greatest hits, “Knock Knock.” Even then, his ambitions still reflected a youthful, money-focused style:</p>

  <p class="lyrics">“People was amazed I was still in high school<br> But now I'm out, and money what I'm 'bout<br>Trying to get so much that I can't keep count...”</p><br>

<p>Miller’s music continued to reflect his mellow and stoner ways. In 2011, Miller released his next mixtape, <span class="italic">Best Day Ever</span>, but this reflected the same repetitive and materialistic style.</p><br>

<h1 id="mixtapes">And his mixtapes continued...</h1><br>

<p>Fast Forward after another EP and mixtape and then comes <span class="italic">Blue Slide Park</span> that same year.</p>

<p>The studio album received criticism from across the board.</p>

<p>“Released two months before his 20th birthday, <span class="italic">Blue Slide Park</span> finds Miller rapping about crazy parties and getting money; his personality is effervescent, but his similes are clumsy and the production includes a grab-bag of dissenting styles,” said <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8474221/mac-miller-blue-slide-park-chart-history-pushed-him-to-strive-for-more"target="_blank">Billboard</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of the backlash, <span class="italic">Blue Slide Park</span> pushed Miller to keep going. In fact, from then on, Miller’s music emerged from the repetitive and stagnant into the deeper and more complex.</p>

</p>Miller was arrested for marijuana possession in 2011.</p>

<p>But his legal troubles would not end there.</p><br>

<h1 id="man">A man comes out of music</h1><br>

<p>Mac’s 2012 mixtape, <span class="italic">Macadelic</span>, was one of the first pieces of evidence that he wasn’t some washed-up, superficial young rapper.</p>

<p>He was a man of emotions and used music as an outlet.</p>

<p>His song, “Desperado,” reflected more of his mind at the time:</p>

  <p class="lyrics">“Put me in a room of people, how the f**k could I be lonely?<br>I only get money, these labels tryna clone me<br>Uh, my thoughts get heavy, hit the ground and crack the concrete<br>So, I try to keep 'em in my head<br>
It's sad to see when everything that you believe is dead…”</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Miller’s drug use began to take a turn. In his <span class="italic">Macadelic</span> tour in 2012, Miller played at over 50 shows throughout the U.S. and Europe. “To help manage the stress he started using promethazine,” according to <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2013/01/mac-miller-2013-online-cover-story"target="_blank">Complex.</a> “Somewhere along the way he became addicted.”</p><br>

<h1 id="personal">A more personal touch</h1><br>

<p>Miller’s music became even more personal with his 2013 studio album, <span class="italic">Watching Movies with the Sound off</span>.</p>

<p>In “The Star Room,” Miller reflects on the demons inside his own head and the repercussions of his drug use:</p>

  <p class="lyrics">“But me, I'm still trapped inside my head<br>
It kinda feel like it's a purgatory<br>
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me<br>
Think I'm living paradise, so would I have to worry 'bout?<br>
Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure<br>
Find the perfect style<br>
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love<br>
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs…”</p><br>

<h1 id="demons">Some demons don't die inside</h1><br>

<p>Miller’s inner demons reflected even more in his 2013 mixtape, <span class="italic">Delusional Thomas</span>.</p>

<p>Miller recorded the material under the name Delusional Thomas, while using a distorted and higher-pitched voice in his songs.</p>

<p>“But to me it was a character and I wanted to give his whole own complete, like, everything,” Miller said in an interview with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/rkpme6/mac-miller-interview-delusional-thomas" target="_blank">VICE</a>.</p>

<p>“There was part of me that wanted to do my own voice, but I just wanted it to be its own complete character. And I feel like that evil voice inside your head is always kind of in that pitch.”</p><br>

<h1 id="drugs">Depression, Drugs and Depth</h1><br>

<p>Miller’s 2014 mixtape, <span class="italic">Faces</span>, offered more of a glimpse into his issues with depression and drugs.</p>

<p>The last song, “Grand Finale,” was meant to be Miller’s last song on Earth.</p>

<p>“He rapped as if tomorrow was uncertain, like overdosing was a possibility he considered to be drawing nearer,” wrote Yoh Phillips of <a href="https://djbooth.net/features/2017-03-29-mac-miller-faces-artists-killing" target="_blank">DJBooth</a>.</p>

<p>The mixtape “chronicled his depression and how ‘a drug habit like Philip Hoffman will probably put me in a coffin,’ mentioning cocaine, codeine cough syrup and even angel dust,” according to Alex Gale of <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6663072/mac-miller-interview-donald-trump-drugs-drake-meek-mill-good-am-album" target="_blank">Billboard</a>.</p>

<p>“Faces was, in short, super depressing, and I’m not as depressed anymore,” Miller said in a Billboard interview. “Making music when you’re depressed is great therapy, but I wanted [<span class="italic">GO:OD AM</span>] to be in a different headspace.”</p></br>

<h1 id="new">A new kind of voice</h1><br>

<p>Critics saw Miller’s third studio album, <span class="italic">GO:OD AM</span>, as his most refined project of 2015.</p>

<p>“And on the transparent, relaxed <span class="italic">GO:OD AM</span>, he sounds like someone’s troubled little brother made good: from the album’s opening horns, you can sense that this is a victory lap for Mac, a homecoming,” according to Tayler Montague of <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21038-mac-miller-good-am/" target="_blank">Pitchfork</a>.</p>

<p>Miller’s song “Clubhouse” points to his growing fame and influence:</p>

  <p class="lyrics">“And I don't see why these kids wanna grow up to be just like me (Yeah)<br>
I was a nobody, now my name in they mouth<br>
Came for a steak but I left with the cow<br>
And they hate when you great though<br>
Ain't shit change but my checking account (Mac Milly)...”</p>

<p>“As is the case with so many talented young people who become rich and successful at lightning speed, soon enough, Miller was pretty heavily hooked on drugs,” Patricia Garcia of <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/mac-miller-the-divine-feminine-album" target="_blank">Vogue</a> said.<p><br>

<h1 id="album">The album that led to everything</h1><br>

<p>But Miller’s 2016 studio album, <span class="italic">The Divine Feminine</span>, changed everything for him.</p>

<p>As Garcia notes, “gone are the lyrics about drugs, money, and death; instead, <span class="italic">The Divine Feminine</span> is upbeat, hopeful, and pretty damn sexy, too.”</p>

<p>Miller began dating pop-star Ariana Grande in August 2016. Grande accompanied Miller in <span class="italic">The Divine Feminine</span> track, “My Favorite Part.”</p>

<p>“That song is beautiful and it’s an aspect about my life,” Miller said in an interview with <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/mac-miller-the-divine-feminine-album" target="_blank">Vogue</a>.</p>

<p>“I’m still trying to figure out how to navigate [talking about my relationship].”</p>

<p>Miller’s lyrics in <span class="italic">The Divine Feminine</span> prove that love had become his new drug.</p>

<p>“I think it also opened the door for me to become a bit more vulnerable with how I speak and what I say and how I use my voice,” Miller said.</p>

<p>Shortly he released <span class="italic">The Divine Feminine</span>, Miller was nearly three months into sobriety.</p>

<p>“I am actually completely sober for the first time,” Miller told Vogue. “I’m just changing how I live life, my state of mind.”</p>

<p>But sobriety did not last long for him.</p>

<p>“I’ve spent a good time very sober and now I’m just, like, living regularly,” Miller said in an April 2017 interview with <a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/story/mac-miller-coachella-2017-interview/" target="_blank">W Magazine</a>.</p>

<p>“I think it’s important. I don’t believe in absolute anything.”</p>

<p>In May 2018, Miller and Grande parted ways.</p>

<p>“We worked through good times, bad times, stress and everything else,” Miller said to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8466628/mac-miller-responds-ariana-grande-breakup-engagement" target="_blank">Billboard</a>.</p>

<p>“And then it came to an end and we both moved on. And it’s that simple, you know?”</p>

<p>Miller was arrested on DUI and hit-and-run charges later that month, according to <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/mac-miller-arrested-on-dui-and-hit-and-run-charges/" target="_blank">Us Weekly</a>.</p><br>

<h1 id="death">On the verge of death</h1><br>

<p>Miller dug even deeper into his insecurities, sadness and depression with his 2018 studio album, <span class="italic">Swimming</span>.</p>

<p>“There’s some material in <span class="italic">Swimming</span> that goes far deeper than Mac has ever gone before,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFCZroOJ8e0" target="_blank">Alfo Media</a> notes.</p>

<p>“It’s almost as if Mac is trying to find the lightest parts in a very dark point in his life.”</p>

<p>Miller recognizes his sadness and uses his music as a way to understand his feelings. The album debuted only three months after Miller and Grande broke up.</p>

<p>In the beginning of “Come Back to Earth,” Miller is aware of the mistakes he’s made:</p>

  <p class="lyrics">“My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send<br>
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers<br>
We could be friends<br>
I just need a way out of my head<br>
I'll do anything for a way out<br>
Of my head...”</p>

<p>Little did the world know that <span class="italic">Swimming</span> was the last album Miller would release while alive.</p>

<p>Miller died at the age of 26 in his Los Angeles home on September 7, 2018.</p>


<p>The cause: a deadly combination of cocaine, fentanyl and alcohol, according to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/rapper-mac-miller-died-drug-overdose-n931361" target="_blank">NBC News</a>.</p><br>

<h1 id="life">Miller’s life ended, but his music didn’t</h1><br>

<p>His studio album, <span class="italic">Circles</span>, came out in January 2020.</p>

<p>“It’s an optimistic epilogue to the life of an aspirational artist,” noted <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mac-miller-circles/" target="_blank">Pitchfork</a> in their album review.</p>

<p>“<span class="italic">Circles</span> provides some resolution and helps finish Miller’s final thoughts.”</p>

<p>Miller bridges together the struggle of mental health and realizing there are ways to deal with it.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mac-miller-circles/" target="_blank">Pitchfork</a> notes, his lyrics in “Surf” serve as a thesis for the album:</p>

  <p class="lyrics">“And I know that somebody knows me<br>
I know somewhere there's home<br>
I'm startin' to see that all I have to do is get up and go…”</p>

<p>His posthumous work is an act of reflection and self-improvement. Miller pieces together his life.</p>

<p>“The day that I die on will turn me into an icon,” Miller once said.</p>

<p>He surely wasn’t wrong.</p>
