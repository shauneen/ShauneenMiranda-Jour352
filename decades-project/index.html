  <h1 id="begin">The Beginnings</h1>

  <p>Critics initially thought Ms. magazine would run out of things to say.</p>

  <p>A feminist, sisterhood-oriented, nationally-circulated magazine became a powerful force during the rising 1970s women’s movement in the United States.</p>

  <p>But before uncovering how Ms. magazine emerged into the center of the feminist press, we must start at the beginning.</p>

<h1 id="need">Why was there a need for a feminist press in the first place?</h1>

<p>“Well, we can see why when we go out and try to buy another kind of newspaper, which is the usual kind, and we see how they cover the issues that are most vile to women,” said Nancy Borman, publisher for the discontinued feminist publication <a href="https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_81-36tx9b1j"target="_blank">The Majority Report,</a> during a 1976 interview. “They’re always covered from the male point of view and from an establishment point of view, and a serious movement for social change like the women’s movement is treated like a joke. In the feminist press, we cover the issues from a woman’s point of view, such as the issue of rape.”</p>
<br>
<iframe style='display: flex; flex-direction: column; min-height: 50vh; width: 100%;' src='https://americanarchive.org/embed/cpb-aacip-81-36tx9b1j?start=80.29&end=157.37'></iframe>
<br>
<p>Borman expressed her beliefs about the need for a feminist press, saying “by and large, I don’t think that we can afford to leave to a male-dominated press the job of covering what’s going on in our lives.”</p>
<p> Borman’s words resonated with women journalists and audiences across the nation. Not only was standard reporting from a man’s point of view, issues plaguing women remained largely undiscussed and out of the larger media landscape. Domestic violence and sexual harassment were deemed too controversial, and if they did receive attention, the male perspective remained largely inadequate for the women experiencing these gendered forms of discrimination and mistreatment.</p>
<p>A feminist press, therefore, allowed for a legitimate platform, where women could now be free from any overarching male-dominated media standards and write about their own struggles.</p>
<p>“There’s a tremendous gap between what the media presents as the women’s movement and the women’s movement,” said Janis Kelly of <a href="https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_81-36tx9b1j"target="_blank">Off Our Backs.</a> “We would like to offer a direct way for women to know about the women’s movement.”</p>

<div class="container">
    <p class="subhead">
<h1 id="1960s">Feminism in the late 1960s to 1970s</h1>

<p>But what was the landscape of the feminist movement in the 1970s? How did the emergence of the feminist press intersect with the second wave of feminism? The 1960s saw a rise in the feminist movement, a greater call for equality and the tenacity among key figures like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem.</p>
<p>Betty Friedan’s 1963 book, The Feminine Mystique, has been credited for igniting the second wave of feminism in the U.S., according to Jacob Muñoz in <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/powerful-complicated-legacy-betty-friedans-feminine-mystique-180976931/"target="_blank">Smithsonian Magazine.</a> Friedan’s work “tapped into the dissatisfaction of American women,” and “appealed to women who were unhappy with their so-called idyllic life, addressing their discontent with the ingrained sexism in society that limited their opportunities.”</p>
<p>Friedan’s book brought topics to light on a national scale, ranging from workplace equality, to birth control and women’s education, according to Muñoz.</p>
<p>Little did the world know that the words and beliefs of Friedan would echo throughout the country and become a widespread movement.</p>
<p>Legislation in the 1970s reflected the increasing pressure from women to obtain more rights and equality with men. The Equal Rights Amendment passed in Congress in 1972, although the legislation would never see full ratification and met its demise in 1982, according to Amy Erdman Farrell in her book,<a href="https://www.scribd.com/read/362060909/Yours-in-Sisterhood-Ms-Magazine-and-the-Promise-of-Popular-Feminism#Yours"target="_blank"> Yours in Sisterhood: Ms. Magazine and the Promise of Popular Feminism.</a></p>
<p>“By the time Ms. magazine began publishing, women had won a number of legal and legislative victories, thanks to the work of NOW and its offshoot, the Women’s Equity Action League, formed in 1968 to focus on legal and economic issues affecting women,” Farrell said.</p>
<br>



<h1 id="steinem">Gloria Steinem: A Feminist Icon</h1>



<p>Then comes Gloria Steinem, an activist, journalist and a woman incredibly ahead of her time</p>
<p>Steinem helped found the The National Women’s Political Caucus in 1971 and played a major role in the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.</p>
<p>As a journalist for New York magazine, Steinem was aware of the issues facing women, but also the difficult role in the industry given her gender.</p>
<p>When asked by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation host Moses Znaimer in a 1968 interview on whether Steinem capitalized on her beauty, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2574018998"target="_blank">she responded</a>: “In this short term, I think probably yes, because it is like being a Negro. People remember you. They say, ‘Oh, that writer who’s a girl,’ in the same way they say, ‘Oh, that writer who’s Black or who’s an American Indian, but in the long term, it doesn’t help. They don’t take you seriously.”</p>
<p>Steinem saw the need for an avenue of national communication among women. She was also “aware of the discrimination and trivialization women faced in the media.” Although Steinem initially pictured a women’s newsletter, according to Farrell, she began to work with Elizabeth Forsling Harris and Patricia Carbine to start what would eventually become Ms. magazine.</p>

<h1 id="birth">The Birth of Ms. Magazine</h1>

<p>The magazine’s first standalone issue appeared in July 1972, with a figure of <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/ms-vol-1-no-1:nmah_1803345"target="_blank"> Wonder Woman</a> on the front cover. This imagery epitomized what this new feminist publication stood for: a platform for women’s empowerment.</p>
<p>“Dressed in her red, white, and blue sparkling outfit, emphasizing pointed breasts, powerful hips, and high-heeled boots...her momentum, her strength, and her size expressed the enthusiasm and energy of the early women’s movement,” Farrell said. “She represented the figure of ‘womanpower,’ the public relations slogan used by national women’s organizations to communicate the potential of women, economic and otherwise.”</p>
<p>Thus, Ms. magazine emerged out of an already established journalism platform: women’s magazines. But unlike Ladies’ Home Journal or Good Housekeeping, women were no longer seen as consumers, kept to the home with domestic responsibilities and largely unfulfilled.</p>
<p>“The founders of Ms. never rejected the institution of the mainstream women’s magazine,” Farrell noted. “Rather, they sought to reclaim and revise it, to make it a resource for women in the movement.”</p>
<p>Ms. wanted to focus on personal change, something that contradicted the values of traditional women’s magazines already in place. Ms. was “rooted in an understanding of sisterhood, of underlying female culture and female superiority that would help revolutionize our society.”</p>
<p>Ms. did not mark the beginning of the feminist press, but this publication that started in the early 1970s would eventually be the focal point of both this new journalism medium and a representation of the new wave of feminism.</p>

<h1 id="reception">Criticism and Pushback</h1>

<p>But, of course, with a feminist publication comes immense criticism and pushback. The 1970s saw a deluge of conservative voices, traditional images of women still permeating the minds of Americans and even negative opinions from U.S. presidents toward the broader movement.
<p>“[E]ven President Nixon condemned it in conversation with Henry Kissinger, released as a part of the White House tapes, asking, ‘For sh*t’s sake, how many people really have read Gloria Steinem and give one sh*t about that?’” according to Chloe Fouissanes in <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a32131889/gloria-steinem-ms-magazine-true-story/Town"target="_blank"> Town and Country Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Ms. published covers that contrasted the standards of typical women’s magazines.</p>
<p>Some of Ms.’s editions were even banned from public libraries out of fears that the front covers and topics presented were too inappropriate for audiences. For instance, a 1977 cover with the title <a href="https://msmagazine.com/2011/11/15/contrarian-views-on-sex-harassment-dangerous-not-funny/"target="_blank">“Sexual Harassment on the Job and How to Stop It</a>,” pictured a large hand groping the insight of a female doll’s shirt.</p>
<p>“Yet many newsstand operators and librarians refused to display the issue, and numerous readers argued that the issue reminded them of Playboy,” Farrell said.</p>
<p>Critics also thought Ms. was particularly vulnerable as a cause magazine, according to Pamela Howard of the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/read/362060909/Yours-in-Sisterhood-Ms-Magazine-and-the-Promise-of-Popular-Feminism"target="_blank">Saturday Review</a>. Skeptics thought Ms. would eventually die out when the women’s movement ended.</p>
<p>“[M]any of the articles took a decidedly skeptical view about the longevity of a women’s movement magazine and an even more doubtful tone about its contents,” as Farrell notes. “For instance, a Newsweek article published in November 1971 explained that ‘predictably enough, the magazine will dwell constantly on the changing role of women in U.S. society, both inside the home and outside it.’”</p>
<p>But this sentiment would prove to be incredibly incorrect.</p>
<p>Despite these criticisms, Ms. continued to thrive in the 1970s and beyond. At its peak readership,<a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a32131889/gloria-steinem-ms-magazine-true-story/Foussianes"target="_blank"> Foussianes</a> noted that the magazine amassed over 3 million readers.</p>
<p>“For many, Ms. appeared to be the mouthpiece of the feminist movement,” according to Foussianes. “Famous and controversial covers about domestic abuse and sexual harassment helped bring awareness to those crucial, previously little-covered issues.”</p>
<p>No other feminist publication garnered as much readership, influence or attention within the feminist press. In fact, “Ms. is the only major feminist publication to maintain mainstream circulation over the years despite many difficult periods,” according to Debra Baker Beck in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4316558?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents"target="_blank">“The ‘F’ Word: How the Media Frame Feminism.”</a></p>

<h1 id="flaws">A Limited Range of Perspectives</h1>

<p>Regardless of the new representation by and for women, Ms. failed to include a broad range of perspectives.
<p>Although Ms. was a feminist publication, the magazine primarily spoke to a White, heterosexual, middle-class feminism.</p>
<p>As Farrell notes, “from its origins, Ms. was primarily a white organization, speaking to and emerging from the white women’s movement.”</p>
<p>Employment throughout Ms. consisted largely of White women. “Despite attempts to include a wide breadth of perspectives and an aspiration to hire more people of color, Ms. was largely staffed by privileged white women, and many thought it represented a limited viewpoint,” Farrell said.</p>
<p>Ms., along with other feminist publications, struggled to survive in the latter part of the twentieth century. For starters, Ms. had difficulties in the advertising realm from its origins.</p>
<p>“Ms. explicitly recognized that advertising can be a powerful influence and that advertisers’ pressure could threaten the integrity of the magazine’s feminist ideology and intrude on its ability to freely address important feminist issues,” according to Anne Cunningham and Eric Haley in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10641734.2000.10505105?casa_token=UT10IYJwTCoAAAAA:hIS7CNx8ufmn4XbcfHhdJD1VTd-M12v0Z0JdoMo5tcD_NFavXuZdauB7fplUm5p7kbF-1w_4dCZrBA"target="_blank">“A Look inside the World of Advertising-Free Publishing: A Case Study of Ms. Magazine.”</a></p>
<p>Ms. tried to transform advertising roles in women’s magazines and “work within consumer culture,” Farrell said. Therefore, Ms. "had to negotiate the competing and often contradictory standards of readers, advertisers, newsstand operators in its creation of covers."</p>
<p>Ms. struggled to find advertisers who were willing to work with them. On the other hand, Ms. was the first major women's magazine to advertise traditionally male products, such as cars, insurance or credit cars, according to Farrell. For the first time ever, readers were now regarded as "full" human beings.</p>
<p>Women could now feel more empowered as readers and were less bombarded with advertisements that perpetuated stereotypical roles that limited their lives to child bearing and domestic labor.</p>
<p>But regardless of these advertisements Ms. used to help strengthen their messages and empower more women, many companies were reluctant to work with a feminist publication and identify themselves with a women's organization.</p>
<p>The conservative climate in the 1970s and 1980s, according to Farrell, "placed Ms. in an increasingly embattled position."</p>
<p>In a 1989 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/11/04/the-demise-of-ms-magazine/d58d1d83-6076-4e10-87c7-67b84a6a360c/"target="_blank"> Washington Post</a> piece, Paul Farhi references the work of former Good Housekeeping editor in chief John Mack Carter, who said that "'feminist ideology is simply antithetical to [certain] kinds of advertisers.'"</p>

<h1 id="jezebel">Impact and Similarities to Today</h1>

<p>Fast forward to the 2000s, and feminism in the media still faces challenges and criticisms. At the very basis, “for feminists, being cast as outsiders, trouble-makers, even evil women, is inevitable since they challenge the very basis of a patriarchal society,” Beck said.</p>
<p>However, the news is responsible for the portrayal and dissemination of feminist ideas. Whether put in a positive or negative light, the media serves as the sole messenger of feminism.</p>

<p>Therefore, Beck explains how, “as annoying as the mass media might be, today’s feminists would not have a movement without them.”</p>
<p>Newer feminist media platforms have developed throughout the late 1990s into the early 2000s, echoing the influence and struggles of earlier publications like Ms. magazine.</p>

<p>Take <a href="https://jezebel.com/"target="_blank">Jezebel,</a> for instance, a feminist news site and blog that began in 2007 and has helped push feminist ideas into a more mainstream light.</p>


<p>Jezebel “has been so successful in changing women’s media that its once-signature blend of confessional essays, raunchy humor and outrage culture is no longer unique,” said Jordan Michael Smith in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/20/jezebel-website-changed-womens-media"target="_blank">The Guardian</a>.</p>

<p>“Conversations that used to take place in Jezebel’s comments section now occur on Twitter.”</p>

<p>Similar to Ms., Jezebel offered an avenue for women’s voices, making feminist ideas more widely discussed and accepted. But now, this feminist impact occurs in an Internet-filled, social media-driven world.</p>

<p>Nowadays, feminist sentiment spreads across social media outlets such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Feminist writing that intitially involved a tedious effort of magazine distribution and print journalism can now be executed in a matter of seconds and under 280 characters.</p>

<p>During the beginning stages, Jezebel also experienced criticisms that reflect in Ms.’s earliest days.</p>

<p>“Jezebel did not become one of the fastest-growing sites in the Gawker family without making a few enemies,” according to Jennifer Mascia in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/12/business/media/12jezebel.html"target="_blank"> The New York Times.</a></p>
<p>Mascia mentions the words of Gaby Darbyshire, Gawker Media’s chief operating officer, who said that “‘In its lifetime, Jezebel has received more complaints per year than any other site.’” Darbyshire said that the posts ‘that discuss subjects with critical commentary usually draw the hottest fire.’”</p>
<p>Jezebel, just like Ms., inspired other feminist platforms, but this time being on the Internet. Although Jezebel might not have drawn direct inspiration from Ms., the stark similarities demonstrate the everlasting difficulties within a feminist publication, regardless of the changing political and social landscape.</p>

<p>Here, in the 21st century, with a woman as vice president in the U.S. and more female representation than ever before, feminist ideas are still often met with criticism.</p>

<p>“Soon, a plethora of new sites appeared that mimicked Jezebel’s formula to one degree or another,” Mascia said. “Slate’s Double X, xoJane, The Hairpin and The Frisky were among the most popular.”</p>

<p>“‘The fact that a woman’s site could exist … that was Jezebel-influenced,’” according to former Jezebel writer Jia Tolentino.</p>

<p>Jezebel’s similarities to Ms. underscore just how impactful feminist publications continue to be.</p>

<p>Regardless, a long, difficult road lies ahead in the fight for women’s equality and representation, both in the media and in society.</p>
