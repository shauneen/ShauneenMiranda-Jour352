  <p> ritics initially thought Ms. magazine would run out of things to say.</p>
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>A feminist, sisterhood-oriented, nationally-circulated magazine became a powerful force during the rising 1970s women’s movement in the United States.</p>

  <p>But before uncovering how Ms. magazine emerged into the center of the feminist press, we must start at the beginning.</p>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <br>
<h1 id="need">Why was there a need for a feminist press?</h1>
<br>

<p>“Well, we can see why when we go out and try to buy another kind of newspaper, which is the usual kind, and we see how they cover the issues that are most vile to women,” said Nancy Borman, publisher for the discontinued feminist publication <a href="https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_81-36tx9b1j"target="_blank">The Majority Report,</a> during a 1976 interview. “They’re always covered from the male point of view and from an establishment point of view, and a serious movement for social change like the women’s movement is treated like a joke. In the feminist press, we cover the issues from a woman’s point of view, such as the issue of rape.”</p>
<br>

<video width="500" height="400" controls="controls" class="center">
<source src="images/whyfeministpress.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br><br>

<p>Borman expressed her beliefs about the need for a feminist press, saying “by and large, I don’t think that we can afford to leave to a male-dominated press the job of covering what’s going on in our lives.”</p>
<p> Borman’s words resonated with women journalists and audiences across the nation. Not only was standard reporting from a man’s point of view, issues plaguing women remained largely undiscussed and out of the larger media landscape. Domestic violence and sexual harassment were deemed too controversial, and if they did receive attention, the male perspective remained largely inadequate for the women experiencing these gendered forms of discrimination and mistreatment.</p>
<p>A feminist press allowed for a legitimate platform, where women could now be free from any overarching male-dominated media standards and write about their own struggles.</p>
<p>“There’s a tremendous gap between what the media presents as the women’s movement and the women’s movement,” said Janis Kelly of <a href="https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_81-36tx9b1j"target="_blank">Off Our Backs</a>, another discontinued feminist publication. “We would like to offer a direct way for women to know about the women’s movement.”</p>
<br>

</div>

<p>But what was the landscape of the feminist movement in the 1970s? How did the emergence of the feminist press intersect with the second wave of feminism? The 1960s saw a rise in the feminist movement, a greater call for equality and the tenacity among key figures like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem.</p>
<p>Betty Friedan’s 1963 book,<span class="italic1">The Feminine Mystique</span>, has been credited for igniting the second wave of feminism in the U.S., according to Jacob Muñoz in <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/powerful-complicated-legacy-betty-friedans-feminine-mystique-180976931/"target="_blank">Smithsonian Magazine</a>. Friedan’s work “tapped into the dissatisfaction of American women,” and “appealed to women who were unhappy with their so-called idyllic life, addressing their discontent with the ingrained sexism in society that limited their opportunities.”</p>
<p>Friedan’s book brought topics to light on a national scale, ranging from workplace equality, to birth control and women’s education, according to Muñoz.</p>
<p>Her words and beliefs would soon echo throughout the country and help start a widespread feminist movement.</p>
<p>Legislation in the 1970s reflected the increasing pressure from women to obtain more rights and equality. Although the Equal Rights Amendment passed in Congress in 1972, this effort would never see full ratification and met its demise in 1982, according to Amy Erdman Farrell in her book, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/read/362060909/Yours-in-Sisterhood-Ms-Magazine-and-the-Promise-of-Popular-Feminism#Yours"target="_blank"><em>Yours in Sisterhood: Ms. Magazine and the Promise of Popular Feminism</em></a>.</p>
<p>“By the time Ms. magazine began publishing, women had won a number of legal and legislative victories, thanks to the work of [the National Organization for Women] and its offshoot, the Women’s Equity Action League, formed in 1968 to focus on legal and economic issues affecting women,” Farrell said.</p>

<div class="container">

<br>

<p>Then comes Gloria Steinem, an activist, journalist and a woman incredibly ahead of her time.</p>
<p>Steinem helped found the The National Women’s Political Caucus in 1971 and played a major role in the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.</p>
<p>As a journalist for New York magazine, Steinem was aware of the issues facing women.</p>
<p>When asked by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation host Moses Znaimer in a 1968 interview on whether Steinem capitalized on her beauty, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2574018998"target="_blank">she responded</a>: “In this short term, I think probably yes, because it is like being a Negro. People remember you. They say, ‘Oh, that writer who’s a girl,’ in the same way they say, ‘Oh, that writer who’s Black or who’s an American Indian,’ but in the long term, it doesn’t help. They don’t take you seriously.”</p>
<div class="container">

<source src="images/steinem-interview.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br><br>
</div>
<div class="container">

<p>Steinem saw the need for an avenue of national communication among women. She was also “aware of the discrimination and trivialization women faced in the media.” Although Steinem initially pictured a women’s newsletter, according to Farrell, she began to work with Elizabeth Forsling Harris and Patricia Carbine to start what would eventually become Ms. magazine.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <br>
<h1 id="birth">The Birth of Ms. Magazine</h1>
<br>

<p>Ms. magazine’s first standalone issue appeared in July 1972, with a figure of <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/ms-vol-1-no-1:nmah_1803345"target="_blank"> Wonder Woman</a> on the front cover. This imagery epitomized what Ms. stood for: a platform for women’s empowerment.</p>
<p>“Dressed in her red, white, and blue sparkling outfit, emphasizing pointed breasts, powerful hips, and high-heeled boots...her momentum, her strength, and her size expressed the enthusiasm and energy of the early women’s movement,” Farrell said. “She represented the figure of ‘womanpower,’ the public relations slogan used by national women’s organizations to communicate the potential of women, economic and otherwise.”</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="container">

    </div>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
<br>

<div class="container">

<p>Thus, Ms. magazine emerged out of an already established journalism medium: women’s magazines. But unlike Ladies’ Home Journal or Good Housekeeping, women were no longer seen as consumers and kept to the home with mindless domestic tasks.</p>
<p>“The founders of Ms. never rejected the institution of the mainstream women’s magazine,” Farrell noted. “Rather, they sought to reclaim and revise it, to make it a resource for women in the movement.”</p>
<p>Ms. wanted to focus on personal change, something that contradicted the values of traditional women’s magazines already in place. Ms. was “rooted in an understanding of sisterhood, of underlying female culture and female superiority that would help revolutionize our society.”</p>
<p>Ms. did not mark the beginning of this new kind of journalism, but the magazine would eventually become the focal point of the feminist press and represent the second wave of feminism.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="reception">Criticism and Pushback</h1>
<br>

<p>But with any feminist publication, so too comes immense criticism and pushback. The 1970s brought a deluge of conservative voices, traditional images of women that permeated the minds of Americans and negative opinions about feminism from some U.S. presidents.
<p>“[E]ven President Nixon condemned it in conversation with Henry Kissinger, released as a part of the White House tapes, asking, ‘For sh*t’s sake, how many people really have read Gloria Steinem and give one sh*t about that?’” according to Chloe Foussianes in <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a32131889/gloria-steinem-ms-magazine-true-story/Town"target="_blank"> Town & Country Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Ms. published covers that contrasted the standards of typical women’s magazines.</p>
<p>Some of Ms.’s editions were even banned from public libraries out of fear that the front covers and topics were too inappropriate for audiences. For instance, a 1977 cover with the title <a href="https://msmagazine.com/2011/11/15/contrarian-views-on-sex-harassment-dangerous-not-funny/"target="_blank">“Sexual Harassment on the Job and How to Stop It,”</a> pictured a large hand groping the inside of a female doll’s shirt.</p>
<br>
<figure>
<img src="images/harassment-cover.png" alt="mag" width="500" height="600" class="center"><br>
<div align="center">
      <span class="italic" class="center">Source/Ms. magazine</span>
    </div>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“Yet many newsstand operators and librarians refused to display the issue, and numerous readers argued that the issue reminded them of Playboy,” Farrell said.</p>
<p>Critics also thought Ms. was particularly vulnerable as a cause magazine, according to Pamela Howard of the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/read/362060909/Yours-in-Sisterhood-Ms-Magazine-and-the-Promise-of-Popular-Feminism"target="_blank">Saturday Review</a>. Skeptics thought Ms. would eventually die out when the women’s movement ended.</p>
<p>“[M]any of the articles took a decidedly skeptical view about the longevity of a women’s movement magazine and an even more doubtful tone about its contents,” as Farrell notes. “For instance, a Newsweek article published in November 1971 explained that ‘predictably enough, the magazine will dwell constantly on the changing role of women in U.S. society, both inside the home and outside it.’”</p>
<p>But this sentiment would prove to be largely incorrect. Ms. continued to thrive in the 1970s and beyond. At its peak readership,<a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a32131889/gloria-steinem-ms-magazine-true-story/Foussianes"target="_blank"> Foussianes</a> noted that the magazine amassed over 3 million readers.</p>
<p>“For many, Ms. appeared to be the mouthpiece of the feminist movement,” according to Foussianes. “Famous and controversial covers about domestic abuse and sexual harassment helped bring awareness to those crucial, previously little-covered issues.”</p>
</div>

<br>
<div class="container">
<h1 id="flaws">A Limited Range of Perspectives</h1>
<br>

<p>Regardless of the new representation by and for women, Ms. failed to include a broad range of perspectives. The magazine primarily spoke to a kind of White, heterosexual, middle-class feminism.</p>
<p>As Farrell notes, “from its origins, Ms. was primarily a white organization, speaking to and emerging from the [W]hite women’s movement.”</p>
<br>
<figure>
<img src="images/office.jpg" alt="mag" width="500" height="300" class="center"><br>
<div align="center">

    </div>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Employment throughout Ms. mostly consisted of White women. “Despite attempts to include a wide breadth of perspectives and an aspiration to hire more people of color, Ms. was largely staffed by privileged [W]hite women, and many thought it represented a limited viewpoint,” Farrell said.</p>
<p>Ms., along with other feminist publications, struggled to survive in the latter part of the twentieth century. Advertising created one of the magazine's greatest obstacles to suceeding.</p>
<p>“Ms. explicitly recognized that advertising can be a powerful influence and that advertisers’ pressure could threaten the integrity of the magazine’s feminist ideology and intrude on its ability to freely address important feminist issues,” according to Anne Cunningham and Eric Haley in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10641734.2000.10505105?casa_token=UT10IYJwTCoAAAAA:hIS7CNx8ufmn4XbcfHhdJD1VTd-M12v0Z0JdoMo5tcD_NFavXuZdauB7fplUm5p7kbF-1w_4dCZrBA"target="_blank">“A Look inside the World of Advertising-Free Publishing: A Case Study of Ms. Magazine.”</a></p>
<p>Ms. tried to transform advertising roles in women’s magazines and “work within consumer culture,” Farrell said. Therefore, Ms. “had to negotiate the competing and often contradictory standards of readers, advertisers, newsstand operators in its creation of covers."</p>
<p>Ms. struggled to find advertisers who were willing to work with them. On the other hand, Ms. was the first major women’s magazine to advertise traditionally male products, such as cars, insurance and credit cards, according to Farrell. For the first time in the history of women’s magazines, readers were regarded as “full” human beings.</p>
<p>Women could now feel more empowered as readers and were no longer bombarded with advertisements that perpetuated stereotypical roles of child bearing and domestic work.</p>
<p>Despite the advertisements Ms. used to help strengthen their messages and empower more women, many companies were reluctant to work with a feminist publication and identify themselves with a women's organization.</p>
<p>The conservative climate in the 1970s and 1980s, according to Farrell, “placed Ms. in an increasingly embattled position.”</p>
<p>In a 1989 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/11/04/the-demise-of-ms-magazine/d58d1d83-6076-4e10-87c7-67b84a6a360c/"target="_blank"> Washington Post</a> piece, Paul Farhi references the work of former Good Housekeeping editor-in-chief John Mack Carter, who said that “‘feminist ideology is simply antithetical to [certain] kinds of advertisers.’”</p>

<br>
<h1 id="jezebel">Impact and Similarities to Today</h1>
<br>

<p>Fast forward to the 2000s, and feminism in the media still faces challenges and criticisms. “For feminists, being cast as outsiders, trouble-makers, even evil women, is inevitable since they challenge the very basis of a patriarchal society,” according to Debra Baker Beck in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4316558?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents"target="_blank">“The ‘F’ Word: How the Media Frame Feminism.”</a></p>
<p>However, the news is responsible for the portrayal and dissemination of feminist ideas. Whether put in a positive or negative light, the media serves as the sole messenger of feminism.</p>

<p>Therefore, Beck explains how, “as annoying as the mass media might be, today’s feminists would not have a movement without them.”</p>
<p>Newer feminist media platforms have developed throughout the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, echoing the influence and struggles of earlier publications like Ms. magazine.</p>

<p>Take <a href="https://jezebel.com/"target="_blank">Jezebel</a>, for instance. This feminist news website and blog began in 2007 and has helped push feminist ideas into a more mainstream light.</p>
<br>
<figure>

<div align="center">
      <span class="italic" class="center">Source/Rob Dobi via The Guardian</span>
    </div>
</figure>

<p>Jezebel “has been so successful in changing women’s media that its once-signature blend of confessional essays, raunchy humor and outrage culture is no longer unique,” said Jordan Michael Smith in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/20/jezebel-website-changed-womens-media"target="_blank">The Guardian</a>.</p>

<p>“Conversations that used to take place in Jezebel’s comments section now occur on Twitter.”</p>

<p>Similar to Ms., Jezebel offered an avenue for women’s voices, making feminist ideas more widely discussed and accepted. But now, this feminist impact occurs in an Internet-filled, social media-driven world.</p>

<p>Nowadays, feminist sentiment spreads across social media outlets such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Feminist writing that intitially required a tedious effort of magazine distribution and print journalism now takes a matter of seconds through a tweet or other social media post.</p>

<p>During its beginning stages, critcism toward Jezebel mirrored Ms.’s earliest days.</p>

<p>“Jezebel did not become one of the fastest-growing sites in the Gawker family without making a few enemies,” according to Jennifer Mascia in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/12/business/media/12jezebel.html"target="_blank"> The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>Mascia mentions the words of Gaby Darbyshire, Gawker Media’s co-founder and former chief operating officer, who said that “‘In its lifetime, Jezebel has received more complaints per year than any other site.’” Darbyshire said that the posts “‘that discuss subjects with critical commentary usually draw the hottest fire.’”</p>
<p>Jezebel, just like Ms., inspired other feminist platforms, but this time, through the Internet. Although Jezebel might not have drawn direct inspiration from Ms., the stark similarities demonstrate the continual difficulties within a feminist publication, regardless of the changing political and social landscape.</p>

<p>“Soon, a plethora of new sites appeared that mimicked Jezebel’s formula to one degree or another,” Mascia said. “Slate’s Double X, xoJane, The Hairpin and The Frisky were among the most popular.”</p>

<p>“‘The fact that a woman’s site could exist...that was Jezebel-influenced,’” according to former Jezebel writer Jia Tolentino.</p>

<p>Jezebel’s similarities to Ms. underscore how impactful feminist publications continue to be.</p>

<p>Yet even in 2021, with a woman as vice president of the U.S. and more female representation than ever before, feminist ideas in the media are still often met with criticism and pushback.</p>

<p>A long road lies ahead in the fight for women’s equality and representation, both in the media and in society.</p>
